![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work_in_Progress-yellow)

An end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline for processing, diagnosing, and visualizing golf launch monitor telemetry (Garmin Approach R10). 

This project bridges the gap between raw golf simulator data and actionable coaching insights. Instead of relying on static, one-size-fits-all metrics, it utilizes dynamic baselines (medians) and golf domain knowledge to automatically classify shot quality and identify specific swing flaws.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

1. **Data Ingestion (ETL to AWS):** Automatically extract CSV exports from the Garmin R10 app and load the raw telemetry data into AWS for scalable storage and querying.
2. **Diagnostic Analytics:** Apply a custom, domain-specific algorithm to evaluate shot quality based on the unique baseline of each golf club.
3. **Data Visualization:** Generate intuitive, coach-ready visual reports (e.g., Diverging Bar Charts for miss directions, Stacked Bar Charts for shot quality) to track performance trends.

## 🧠 The Analytics Engine: Dynamic Shot Classification

Traditional golf apps often just show distances. This project implements a **Diagnostic Tagging System** that identifies *why* a shot was missed by cross-referencing Carry Distance, Smash Factor, Launch Angle, Spin Rate, and Carry Deviation. 

Shots are categorized into the following buckets based on beginner-friendly tolerances:

* **🟢 Solid Strike:** Good contact and acceptable direction.
* **⚪️ Thin Shot:** Launch angle drops > 5° below the club's median & Carry < 95%.
* **⚪️ Fat Shot:** Carry drops < 70% & Spin Rate drops < 80% (turf interaction).
* **⚪️ Off-center:** Smash factor drops < 80% of the club's median (heel/toe strikes).
* **⚪️ Severe Offline:** Left/Right deviation exceeds 20% of the carry distance.

## Insights Showcase

Here is an example of the automated reporting generated by the pipeline, evaluating strike quality and consistency across different club types:

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

* **Shot Quality Breakdown:** A stacked bar chart using Solid Strikes as the baseline to evaluate club-by-club consistency.
* **Miss Pattern Analysis:** A diverging bar chart highlighting "One-Way Misses" (e.g., severe slices/pushes vs. hooks/pulls) to inform swing mechanics adjustments.

## 💡 Future Scope
* Automate the AWS ingestion process via AWS Lambda upon file drop.
* Build an interactive Shiny or Streamlit dashboard for real-time practice feedback.
